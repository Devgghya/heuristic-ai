In 2025 alone, there were over 4,000 digital accessibility lawsuits filed in the US. The target? Mostly small-to-mid-sized businesses who "didn't know" their site was broken for screen readers.

Ignorance is not a defense. But manual testing is expensive. 

The solution? **Automated Accessibility Audits.**

## What Can You Automate?
While AI can't test *everything* (you still need humans to test logical flows), it can catch about **40-50% of WCAG failures** instantly.

### 1. Contrast Ratios
**The Rule:** Text must have a 4.5:1 contrast against its background.  
**The Reality:** Most designers love light gray text on white backgrounds. It looks "clean" to them, and "invisible" to everyone else.

<Callout type="check" title="Quick Fix">
Use UIXScore's scanner to identity all low-contrast text. We automatically suggest a darker shade of the same color that meets AA compliance.
</Callout>

### 2. Missing Alt Text
**The Rule:** Every image needs an `alt` attribute.  
**The Reality:** Developers often leave them empty (`alt=""`) or act lazy (`alt="image"`).  

**AI Solution:** Our visual AI analyzes the image and generates a descriptive alt tag for you.  
*Example:* Instead of "img_001.jpg", AI writes "Dashboard screenshot showing a 20% increase in revenue."

### 3. Heading Hierarchy
Screen reader users navigate by jumping from H1 to H2 to H3. If you skip from H2 to H5 because "it looked better," you've broken their map.

### 4. Button Labels
A button called "Click Here" is meaningless out of context.  
**Automation:** Scanners flag vague link text and suggest specific alternatives like "Read our Pricing Guide."

## The "Shift Left" Approach
Don't wait until launch day to audit.  
"Shift Left" means testing **during design and development**.

1.  **Design Phase:** Check contrast in Figma.
2.  **Dev Phase:** Use ESLint plugins (`jsx-a11y`) to catch missing ARIA labels.
3.  **QA Phase:** Run a full scan with UIXScore before deploying.

## Manual Testing is Still Required
Automation is the hygiene check. But you still need to ask:  
*   "Can I use this entire site using ONLY my keyboard?"  
*   "Does the focus state appear clearly on every element?"

## Conclusion
Accessibility makes your site better for everyone (including Google bots).  
Start with the automated "low-hanging fruit."
