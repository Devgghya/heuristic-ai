The classic dilemma: Do you hire an expert for $150/hour, or use a tool for $50/month?

As the creators of an AI audit tool, you might think we'd say "AI is everything." **We won't.**  
There is a time for human insight, and a time for machine speed.

## The Case for AI Audits (UIXScore)

### Pros:
1.  **Speed:** 30 seconds vs. 3 weeks.
2.  **Cost:** Free to $99/mo vs. $3k-$10k project fees.
3.  **Objectivity:** AI doesn't have a "favorite color." It judges based on data and established heuristics.
4.  **Frequency:** You can audit *every single deploy*. You can't hire an agency for every sprint.

### Cons:
1.  **Context Blindness:** AI might flag a "low contrast button" that is actually disabled intentionally.
2.  **Empathy:** AI can't *feel* frustration. It can only predict it.

## The Case for Manual Audits (Agencies)

### Pros:
1.  **Deep & Narrative:** A human can tell you a story about *why* users are churning.
2.  **Complex Flows:** Humans are better at testing multi-step, logic-heavy workflows (e.g., a complex banking transfer wizard).

### Cons:
1.  **Subjectivity:** Different experts give different opinions.
2.  **Price:** It is a luxury service.

## The Hybrid Model: The Winner
The best teams use **both**.

1.  **Use AI for the daily grime.**  
    Use UIXScore to catch the 80% of issues: alignment, contrast, clarity, broken links, heuristic violations. Do this weekly.
    
2.  **Hire Humans for the "Big Redesign."**  
    Once a year, or before a major pivot, bring in human researchers to interview users and watch them use your product.

## Verdict
*   **Freelancer / Startup?** Use AI. You need speed and "good enough" right now.  
*   **Enterprise?** Use AI for your CI/CD pipeline, and hire an agency for your annual review.

**Stop guessing. Start measuring.**
